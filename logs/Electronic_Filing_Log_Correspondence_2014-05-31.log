All three amounts were for production of the three television spots in 2013. The Committee filed 48-hour reports whenever the Committee had an expenditure related to communicating to voters (the gross amounts of the ad buys were promptly reported). The production of the spots, while related, are not actual communications expenditures, and therefore were reported on the Year-End Report, not in a 48-hour report.  Stated differently, these three expenditures were not necessary expenditures that resulted in a public communication, and that is why they were paid on different dates.  Although the Committee will amend and prepare 48-hour reports, going forward, guidance would be appreciated to avoid any future misunderstanding.

WARRIORS FOR LIBERTY
AMENDED MID-YEAR REPORT (01/01/2013 - 6/30/2013)


INCREASE IN REPORTED ACTIVITY

In early February 2014, representatives of Warriors for Liberty were looking for someone to assume the role of Treasurer of the Political Action Committee and replace the original Treasurer.  An amended Statement of Organization (Form 1) was filed on February 6th, listing Scott B. Mackenzie as the new Treasurer.  The first order of business was to amend previously filed FEC Disclosure Reports as the previous Treasurer was not experienced in filing these reports and had difficulty using the FECfile software.

On February 21st, an amended FEC Report was filed that disclosed an increase in receipts totaling $14,441.48 and an increase in disbursements totaling $10,218.51 from the amounts disclosed on your original report.

There were hundreds of transactions, most from the committee's small donor program and the numbers just overwhelmed the previous Treasurer, who although well-meaning, realized that a change was critically needed.

The amended report details all the activity taking place during the reporting period.

Dear Mr. Matheson: 
  
This letter responds to your letter dated April 23, 2014. 
  
11 CFR 109.10(e)(1)(vi) requires that independent expenditure reports identify each person who made a contribution in excess of $200 to the person filing such report, which contribution was made for the purpose of furthering the reported independent expenditure. Freedom Vote did not receive any contributions that were required to be itemized on Schedule 5-A of its FEC Form 5 under this regulation. The expenditures reported on our April Quarterly Report were made with general treasury funds. 
  
Thank you. 
  
Sincerely,

This is in response to an April 23, 2014 FEC inquiry regarding receipts on the 1/1/14-3/31/14 filing.

The FEC has previously advised that this Committee cannot accept reimbursements from
Political Action Together Legislative Educational Committee ( PATLEC) because it is not a 
Federal PAC. As such, previous reimbursements and current reimbursements from PATLEC have 
been refunded. The total amount refunded was $72,000 via check dated April 28, 2014, a copy
 of which is being submitted to the FEC via US mail.

Reimbursements from International Union of Painters and Allied Trades were inadvertently deposited into this Committee.
The reimbursements deposited during the period from 1/1/14-3/31/14 and subsequent reimbursements were refunded 
via check dated April 28, 2014, a copy of which is being submitted to the FEC via US mail. Total amount of $15,000.

The FEC has previously advised that this Committee cannot accept reimbursements from
Political Action Together Legislative Educational Committee ( PATLEC) because it is not a 
Federal PAC. As such, previous reimbursements and current reimbursements from PATLEC have 
been refunded. The total amount refunded was $72,000 via check dated April 28, 2014, a copy
 of which is being submitted to the FEC via US mail.

Reimbursements from International Union of Painters and Allied Trades were inadvertently deposited into this Committee.
The reimbursements deposited during the period from 1/1/14-3/31/14 and subsequent reimbursements were refunded 
via check dated April 28, 2014, a copy of which is being submitted to the FEC via US mail. Total amount of $15,000.

All three amounts were for production of the three television spots in 2013. The Committee filed 48-hour reports whenever the Committee had an expenditure related to communicating to voters (the gross amounts of the ad buys were promptly reported). The production of the spots, while related, are not actual communications expenditures, and therefore were reported on the Year-End Report, not in a 48-hour report.  Stated differently, these three expenditures were not necessary expenditures that resulted in a public communication, and that is why they were paid on different dates.  Although the Committee will amend and prepare 48-hour reports, going forward, guidance would be appreciated to avoid any future misunderstanding.

WARRIORS FOR LIBERTY
AMENDED MID-YEAR REPORT (01/01/2013 - 6/30/2013)


INCREASE IN REPORTED ACTIVITY

In early February 2014, representatives of Warriors for Liberty were looking for someone to assume the role of Treasurer of the Political Action Committee and replace the original Treasurer.  An amended Statement of Organization (Form 1) was filed on February 6th, listing Scott B. Mackenzie as the new Treasurer.  The first order of business was to amend previously filed FEC Disclosure Reports as the previous Treasurer was not experienced in filing these reports and had difficulty using the FECfile software.

On February 21st, an amended FEC Report was filed that disclosed an increase in receipts totaling $14,441.48 and an increase in disbursements totaling $10,218.51 from the amounts disclosed on your original report.

There were hundreds of transactions, most from the committee's small donor program and the numbers just overwhelmed the previous Treasurer, who although well-meaning, realized that a change was critically needed.

The amended report details all the activity taking place during the reporting period.

                       April Quarterly Report (01/01/2014 - 03/31/2014) 
  
Dear Mr. Matheson: 
  
This letter responds to your letter dated April 23, 2014. 
  
11 CFR 109.10(e)(1)(vi) requires that independent expenditure reports identify each person who made a contribution in excess of $200 to the person filing such report, which contribution was made for the purpose of furthering the reported independent expenditure. Freedom Vote did not receive any contributions that were required to be itemized on Schedule 5-A of its FEC Form 5 under this regulation. The expenditures reported on our April Quarterly Report were made with general treasury funds. 
  
Thank you. 
  
Sincerely, 
  
James S. Nathanson
